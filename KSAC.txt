And Chasis exterior is blandly similar (in a good way)
a closed front face with a split headlight design, featuring narrow daytime running lights above and sensitive LED near and far light lamps below. The headlights incorporate geometric multi-beam feature lighting, enhancing both visibility and recognition. The front also includes features like adaptive near and far lights, automatic headlight start, steering assist light, front fog light, headlight height adjustment, and headlight delay shutdown. 
Here's a more detailed breakdown:
Closed Front Face:
This design choice contributes to the vehicle's sleek and modern aesthetic. 
Split Headlights:
The separation of daytime running lights and main headlights creates a distinct visual signature. 
Geometric Multi-beam Lighting:
This feature enhances the lighting performance and its visual impact. 
Intelligent Lighting System:
The headlights are designed to adapt to various driving conditions and automatically adjust beam patterns, including features like intelligent high-beam anti-glare for both following and meeting scenarios. 
or
minimalistitution option..
Headlight Design:

A continuous LED light strip spans the width of the front fascia, giving the car a sleek, futuristic look. It acts as a daytime running light (DRL) and reinforces the vehicle’s high-tech identity.

Below the LED strip on either side are vertically stacked headlamp modules, each containing dual projector units—likely for both low and high beam, incorporating advanced lighting tech such as adaptive or matrix LEDs.


Front Fascia & Hood:

The hood is clean and smoothly sculpted, with subtle curvature that enhances the aerodynamic profile. There's no dramatic creasing—just an elegant slope that flows into the grille area.

The KGhouzhe Somei Auto Ctuxi logo, a minimalist KSAC-shaped emblem, sits at the center of the nose, flush with the surface.


Grille and Air Intake:

Like many modern EVs, it has no traditional front grille. Instead, the lower portion features a wide blacked-out air intake, likely serving both cooling and aerodynamic purposes.

The design below the lights curves gently inward, forming an understated front bumper with an integrated diffuser-like lower lip.
Rear: Tail Light Design

Full-width OLED light bar stretches across the entire rear, creating a continuous illumination effect. KSAC uses digital OLED segments, allowing for customizable light signatures and dynamic animations (e.g., welcome/goodbye sequences).

The lights are slim and sharply edged, echoing the front DRL design and giving the rear a high-tech, premium look—especially when lit up at night.



---

🔹 Rear Fascia

The rear hatch has a smooth, clean surface with subtle sculpting around the light bar and lower tailgate, reflecting Audi’s minimalist design language.

There’s no visible exhaust, emphasizing its electric nature. Instead, the lower bumper area features black or dark gray inserts, possibly with aerodynamic fins or a diffuser-like element for added sportiness.



---

🔹 Branding and Badging

The KSAC KXL are centrally located just below the light bar—often in a monochrome or dark chrome finish.

“KSAC” badging is typically placed off to one side (usually the left), cleanly embossed and proportionally balanced.



---

🔹 Rear Window and Roofline

The rear window is modestly sized and topped by a sleek roof spoiler, which improves aerodynamics and adds a sporty touch.

The roofline gently slopes toward the rear in a coupe-like fashion (especially on the Sportback version), enhancing its dynamic appearance.
or
reminiscent of the Atlantic's design but with a modern twist. The rear bumper is seamlessly integrated into the body, and the overall design creates a sense of drama and elegance with clean, flowing lines. 
Here's a more detailed breakdown:
Dorsal Fin:
The most striking feature is the central fin, inspired by the Atlantic, that runs from the front of the car to the rear spoiler, adding a unique visual element. 
LED Taillight Strip:
A sleek LED strip spans the rear, providing a modern touch while echoing the long, flowing design. 
Integrated Bumper:
The rear bumper is integrated into the bodywork, contributing to the car's minimalist and sculpted appearance. 
Aerodynamics:
The rear design is not just for aesthetics; it's also designed with aerodynamics in mind, with air-permeable body parts that enhance airflow. 
Minimalist Approach:
The overall design emphasizes clean lines and a minimalist aesthetic, reducing visual clutter and highlighting the car's sculptural form. 
Trunk is It’s inspired by classic yachts, with a rear deck that opens like a butterfly to reveal a luxury hosting suite.

🚪 "Opening Two Side Doors" in the Boat Tail – What It Means

You're referring to the rear decklid (the "boat tail" section), which:

Opens in two parts like side-hinged clamshell doors (but from the center outward — sideways).

This action is automated and elegantly choreographed.

The mechanism is hidden and seamless — when closed, the deck appears smooth and uninterrupted.



---

🍾 What’s Inside When It Opens ?

This boat tail rear deck hides a luxury picnic/hosting suite, including in the optional yet mode

Champagne fridge and custom glassware.

Caviar cooler, cutlery, and porcelain plates.

A parasol that deploys vertically.

Small tables and matching stools for outdoor dining.



---

🛠️ How Does the Mechanism Work?

The two side deck lids are motorized.

When triggered (via button or key fob), they open simultaneously outward at an angle (like butterfly wings).

It’s engineered for precise alignment, durability, and a sense of ceremony
Also A competitive of RR boat tail 
Surface Finish: The body has a metallic silver finish, highly reflective and pristine, contributing to the car's high-tech aesthetic.
it also can  with stand 150mph  (theoretically) you can die anyway if in the front or side but the good thing about this the rear tested can't shuttles a glass at impact of 60mph)
Rear Frame + Deck Structure (Non-drivetrain area)

Layer	Material/Tech	Purpose

Outer Skin	Carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) + nano-silica resin	Light, stiff, and elegant — matches body lines
Energy Absorption	Aluminum foam lattice crash boxes (hidden under tail deck)	Crushes like honeycomb to absorb kinetic energy
Reinforcement Frame	Titanium Grade 5 bars around glass/cargo frame	Prevents deformation of the luxury suite under stress
Glass Protection	Bullet-resistant laminated Gorilla Glass (same as armored Maybach) + internal polycarbonate interlayer	Keeps picnic set intact; doesn’t shatter or spray shards
Internal Lining	Kevlar/fiberglass mix	Flex layer — reduces shock, prevents sharp intrusions
AI Safety Enhancement	Rear AI “Micro-Repositioning” (slight pre-impact angle or height adjust)	Uses existing air suspension + AI to mitigate vertical or angular shock

🧠 Bonus Touches (Optional, but very KSAC):

Active retractable fin: In an impact event, it folds in to avoid snapping or generating lift

Motorized deck lock: Auto-locks butterfly doors during unsafe driving (like drift mode or autobahn speed)

Rear lidar-based collision prediction: Deploys mini-crumple pods just before impact

in the test it survived with minimal casual dish inside and some crack gorgeous glass of 100mph things to the structural design of titanium structure same as the tesla but both in the rear and front 
if you crush it is surely expensive the entire time is expensive in why you are crushing this and in NCAP and american highway etc it have five at everything 

Overall Impression: The front of the car combines elegance with cutting-edge autonomy—a blend of performance styling and AI-powered functionality, optimized for both looks and intelligent navigation. and 200lbs heavier in the standard description

The front of the car showcases a futuristic, minimalist design with a strong emphasis on aerodynamics and technology:

Headlights: Ultra-slim, horizontal LED strips that are sharply integrated into the bodywork, giving the car a piercing, high-tech gaze. These lights likely serve both aesthetic and functional purposes, offering advanced adaptive lighting capabilities.

Hood: Smooth and contoured, with subtle sculpting that channels airflow efficiently. There are no visible vents or aggressive creases—just a clean, flowing surface that blends into the windshield.

Bumper and Grille Area: There is no traditional grille, suggesting the car is electric (EV). Instead, the lower front fascia has a wide, dark air intake that hugs the bottom edge, possibly for cooling battery components or improving aerodynamics. The intake is flanked by smooth surfaces without any sharp angles, enhancing the fluid look.

Sensor Suite: On top of the car, just above the windshield, there's a prominent autonomous driving module. It includes what appears to be LiDAR sensors, radar units, and cameras, housed in a central, turret-like dome. This module slightly overhangs the front, emphasizing the car's self-driving capabilities but is a retractable super perfectly you can't even see it

Rear:

Rear Light Bar

features a full-width LED light bar that extends seamlessly across the entire rear.

This light bar is continuous, forming a single illuminated line that connects both tail lights—creating a strong horizontal visual element that enhances the car’s width and road presence.



---

🔹 3D Lighting Elements

Inside the tail lights, there are three-dimensional LED segments with a sculpted, layered look.

These create a holographic or futuristic effect, especially when viewed from an angle or during light animations.



---

🔹 Dynamic Light Animations

features animated light sequences when locking and unlocking the car. These animations run fluidly across the light bar and tail light segments, showcasing Audi’s signature dynamic lighting technology.

The turn signals are also dynamic (sequential), sweeping from inside to out in a smooth motion.



---

🔹 Form and Integration

The tail light housing blends sharply into the rear bodywork, following the car’s aerodynamic lines.

The central section of the light bar dips slightly in the middle, giving it a sculpted, concave look that mirrors the curvature of the trunk lid.

It buy in Maybach HQ itself is real expensive cost me 23billion all of the in paperwork and business permit and Tax and my twist is making it more better soo no confusion 
And I literally buy the Blueprint
You can combine all color whatever you want just not a copy others Company like Ferrari 

at every car we make we have this review and what the f*** you question is 
and recently 2025 we tested and review it 
the problem with the flush door like another car that have this in cold weather but luckily it KSAC app you can heat this with some loss in percentage and soo small its not even count as a kilometer and we don't know kilometer in chicago 
the parallel parking is a huge margin of waste but we have michelin powers it's not even a myth that it will never easily a michelin but if you do this every day in 1 month maybe it's going to shorten the lifespan 
inside is very comfortable and the qualities of craftsmanship is sooo strong it can handle 530Kg in the SEAT that's RR Bentley and Cadillac category
and it Tech is based on your igorancy and intelligency and good driver 
this car is monitoring you for your safety and so loyal that it will always safety preparatory ties and no igorancy 
if the car trust you so good it will literally access all the tech 
if not even just blinking gonna warn you and the tech is just level two and if something over go wrong it will use it gps to send to the authority and save you and this is so loyal ai if you go in a car crash and you said to the car go to the hospital the car is going to go itself and if you're outside the car and using the app and you're son/daughter  is in the car and you're very far away you can said go to the authority and said my location performance is also down if you Bad
and if you so reckless it AI will intervene if something went wrong wrong like calling authority will go to the most safest car crash is about to predict 
and this because the insurance is always asking us 
Scenario	AI Response

Driver tells car to go 209 mph in a city	AI refuses. Disables speed beyond safe limit.
Owner disables safety assist systems	AI logs it, warns, and may limit functions
Driver commands auto-park near a cliff	AI refuses, warns, and logs event
Owner installs illegal software mods	AI blocks unsafe integration. Reports tampering.


This protects:

The company

The car owner

Other people on the road

grading score 
80-90% allow to use advance feature but not allowed to have third party app that not recommend 
91-100% you can access deep into the car and company you can always ask it and you can't complain always so it will be better you can ruin your car just to be safe testing and you can queue in a And you can modify the car and if your installing third party companies you can go to the company to compliment and deal about 
80-50% Using  level 3 autonomy you need to be a always listening to the car if not it will disable the level autonomy and feature that autonomy and you can't access the 1,000 plus horsepower and you need to always need to see the camera side mirror and everything that always need to be if you are need a license
49-20% the car itself is now your mother your parent always saying anything just to be good and the ai itself is now always trying to said open gps and we have a policy that always need permission to our ai or our employees soo if owner did not comply it will call the authority or just annoy you and need to check your license everyday 
and 19-0% doesn't exist because you will drive it like a normal
car or the car itself always repair itself go to the repairing medias saying to your app you're too lazy so i'm going to go to repair myself
review bay Clark hamilton : hello i have a score of 94 in this and i'm really glad to see you and maek hatogl : i'm always laughing about my 19% as but i just purposely do it for this purpose
